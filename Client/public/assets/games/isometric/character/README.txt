The scale you see is approximately 32x32px = 1m^2. Shaped appropriately for 64x32px base tiles (those measure 1.5m^2). This means the sprites are approximately 50px tall -- very similar to the scale used in old games like Fallout, Baldur's Gate, and Diablo. The scale is set to also work well for turn-based games (tactics, rogue-likes).

The same basic equipment is given for both genders. Each is in its own layer:

Base full-body armor (cloth, leather, steel)
Blade weapons (dagger, shortsword, longsword, greatsword)
Ranged weapons (slingshot, shortbow, longbow, greatbow)
Magic weapons (wand, rod, staff, greatstaff)
Shields (buckler, shield)
Each frame of animation is 128x128px (large enough to fit all equipment). Animations are shown in 8 directions.

Running (8 frames)
Melee Swing (4 frames)
Block (2 frames)
Hit and Die (6 frames)

Shoot Bow (4 frames)
Finally, heads are on a separate layer.
